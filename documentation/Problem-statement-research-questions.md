## Problem statement
This research project aims to create a model that focuses on the Nobel laureates in Physics and Chemistry from 1900 to the present. It will examine the key factors contributing to their success, including their geographical, educational, and professional backgrounds, as well as their contributions after receiving the Nobel Prize, along with other relevant aspects. All of this will be achieved by using the prosopography approach. We will systematically collect and analyze specific characteristics of these laureates to identify relations between them and trends over time. This will help create a simplified representation that showcases the different factors that led the laureates to their success.

## Research questions
* Geographical origins of the laureates
* Gender
* Educational background
* Career trajectory 
* Significant publications and collaboration
* Post-Nobel contributions
