## Problem statement
This research project aims to create a model that focuses on the Nobel laureates in Physics and Chemistry from 1900 to the present. It will examine the key factors contributing to their success, including their geographical, educational, and professional backgrounds, as well as their contributions after receiving the Nobel Prize, along with other relevant aspects. All of this will be achieved by using the prosopography approach. We will systematically collect and analyze specific characteristics of these laureates to identify relations between them and trends over time. This will help create a simplified representation that showcases the different factors that led the laureates to their success.

## Research questions
* Is there a correlation between a laureate's socio-demographic factors and their discipline (Physics or Chemistry)?
* How has the geographic distribution of Nobel laureates in Physics and Chemistry changed over time? Are certain contries overly represented ?
* Do certain universities or other institutions increase the chance of becoming a Nobel laureate than others? Have they produced multiple Nobel laureate over time?
* Do Nobel laureates follow contrasting career trajectories and are there common patterns in their professional developement
* What are the significant publication or collaboration of the Nobel laureat that 

## Aspects of the information to be collected
* Geographical origins of the laureates
* Gender
* Educational background
* Career trajectory 
* Significant publications and collaboration
* Post-Nobel contributions
